[explaination]:
Allocated heap memory, but didn't use it. Therefore, the VAs aren't backed up by
physcial memory and in verbose mode, nothing appears.

0x7feeada6c000 0x00057d1b000 1 1 1 1

[explaination]:
Write to the allocated VA, a write fault occurs. Since the VA has been recently
accessed, written to, userspace addressable and moreover, we passed the PROT_WRITE
falg to mmap, thus it's also writable.

All bits are 1 as expected.

[explaination]:
Attempt to read VA 0x7feeada6d000 which is not backed up by any physical memory.
A read fault occurs. Thus the accessed bit is 1. As expected, the writable bit
and user bit are set to 1.

Since it's not written to, the dirty bit is 0.

0x7feeada6d000 is written to after a read fault. Thus, the dirty bit is set to 1.

wirte without fault, nothing changes.

forked the process, and the mapping is now shared.
